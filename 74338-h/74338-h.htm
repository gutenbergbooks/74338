<p class="direction">[<i>Moves over to chair D. S. L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: Very well, thank you, Miss Selina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Has no one else arrived yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: No, miss. Lady Emily and Mr. Carstairs
have been here since yesterday. Mrs. Martineau
and Mr. Molyneux and Mr. Jordan are coming by
the three o’clock train and should be here in a few
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: We would have been down an hour ago if
the car hadn’t been suffering from asthma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Who is the Mr. Jordan who is
coming, Thompson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: I believe him to be in the Cabinet,
m’lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Aren’t you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: Well, in a manner of speaking, yes, Miss
Selina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Why do you always say you believe when
you know, Thompson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: My father always said to me, miss, a
good servant should never presume to be sure. He
should avoid conveying information as if he were
instructing his betters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: A wise man, your father, Thompson—if
only people could get it into their heads that each
time they are right somebody loves them less. How is
her ladyship?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: Overworking, m’lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: What at?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Sits settee L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: Other people’s happiness, Miss Selina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: Her ladyship can’t see that the worthless
is the worthless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: She doesn’t try to improve them, does she,
Thompson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: No, miss—to make them happy. Pampering
the riff-raff that’s what she does. Why, only the
other day she was taken in by a swindler, and do you
know what she said, m’lord?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: She said, “Well, it’s much better than
if he’d been honest and I’d not believed him.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Don’t you try and protect her against herself,
Thompson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: I try, Miss Selina, but then, her ladyship
says: “You aren’t kind to me, Thompson,” and I
capitulate. Human and mortal, that’s what we all
are.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: Miss Selina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: You haven’t admired my new hat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: Very neat, I’m sure——</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Funny, isn’t it, a saint like Ann coming out
of our family.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Tim</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: How de do, Tim?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: How’s Ann?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: She’s looking tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Is Ninian here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: He doesn’t arrive till seven-thirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: The others are coming by the three
o’clock train—Molly, Mr. Jordan and Mrs. Martineau.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I never can think why Ann should see so
much of Mabel Martineau.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: They played together in the nursery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: That’s the only explanation that’s ever
brought forward for Mabel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: She’s rather an amusing little viper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: But she stings so continuously that I don’t
believe she could stop if she wanted to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: She certainly is no respecter of persons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Some day she will sting Ann.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: She really would be fond of Ann if it weren’t
for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: She’s a little bit in love with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: And why not? An attractive,
personable young man like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Papa, you’ve made Tim blush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: It’s easier nowadays to make a
young man blush than a young woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: One’s cheeks can’t always respond to one’s
feelings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Do you know Jordan, Tim?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: A little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: What’s he like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Heavy and common and on the make.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Why does Ann like him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: One of her endowment schemes, I
expect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: What do you mean, Papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: That Ann goes about endowing
people with her own qualities. Very unfair to the poor
things, of course, as they have to revert to type sooner
or later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I don’t know—if she can breathe some of her
own spirit into them they must be permanently enriched.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Molyneux</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr.

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Did you come down by train?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: There was a most charming man
in the carriage—quite drunk. He looked round at us
all and said: “I’m glad I’m not here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Unfortunately he got out at the next
station, which must have taken the edge off his enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Where is Ann?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: We should see more of Ann if we could
appear to her as a duty. Unfortunately, we are undoubtedly
a pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: You might make a bid as sinners in need of
reform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: But that is just what is so wonderful about Ann.
She never wants anyone to be better—only happier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Ann is my niece. She is, of course,
a saint, but she is not a fool. No Cathcart is a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Amen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Don’t interrupt. I was about to say
something very good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Would you like to “think it out in silence?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: What were we talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: There <i>is</i> only one subject in this
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: We were talking about Ann.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Yes—but what were you actually
saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Tim said that Ann never tried to make people
good, but only happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Only!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I remember I was about to say that
in practice goodness and happiness are much the same
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Bravo!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: My dear Bill, surely that is a platitude?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Even a platitude can contain a
truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: But we are few of us brave enough to
admit it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: What do you think, Mr. Jordan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: I think that the truth can be found in very
unexpected places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: The obvious, for instance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: I wasn’t thinking of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Is this your first visit here, Mr.
Jordan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Then you know Ninian?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: I have just met Lord Candover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Then you know Ninian.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>They laugh.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Ninian is first-hand information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: That you learn all there is to be learnt the
first time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: No one can tell you anything about
him. The whole truth is revealed in five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Yes, indeed. It doesn’t take a detective
to know what Ninian is like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: He is the family masterpiece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: By marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: A very inconvenient institution, marriage.
Illogical when you want one thing, to have
another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: You mean when you want one person to
have two?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Precisely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Ninian would be perfect if we didn’t have
so much of him. He never fails one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: He combines under the cover of
an English gentleman—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Of a Lord Lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I accept the amendment, of a Lord
Lieutenant; the ridiculous and the sublime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: And that, mind you, without taking the
proverbial step.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: He is our host and Ann’s husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Tim, you are becoming a prig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Perhaps, but we must think of Ann.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span> (<i>acidly</i>): Perhaps, but you think
of nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Thinking about Ann is a delightful
occupation. It is like thinking about primroses and
spring and lilac bushes and blue-bell woods, all of the
things, in fact, that we are too clever or too stupid to
think about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: You left out skylarks and rippling
brooks and blossoming trees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span> (<i>acidly</i>): And red flannel blankets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: I should like to have forgotten them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Think of Molly dreaming about
primroses and red flannel and you will realize that Ann
is something more than a saint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: A saint who works miracles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: A siren, in fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: You should always remember,
Selina, that virtue has its charms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Which will be a strain, my poor child,
as you will seldom be reminded of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Except when you are staying with Ann.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I am afraid that, however virtuous I may
become, I shall never be as charming as Ann.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span> (<i>acidly</i>): Not in Tim’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Let me beg you, my dear, not to
regard Tim as representative of his sex. He is a knight
errant. He puts women on a pedestal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: A gallant form of shelving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: He divides the world into saints
and cocottes, and, as there are many who fall between
the two stools, they are disposed of as “children of
nature.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: You would be surprised, Selina,
at Tim’s child of nature. She can powder and paint,
languish and pounce, but, if she was never a saint and
is not yet in the gutter, we are forced to accept her as
a pure, wild creature, trapped in our horrible society.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>They laugh.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: You are silent, Jordan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Mr. Jordan is making a reputation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Be careful, you will find it impossible
to lose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: We are a faithful people. A little late,
perhaps, but true to the end. Have you ever known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
an English audience to recognize a singer till she’s forty,
or disown her till she’s dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Remember, Jordan, one evening may
stamp you as a drunkard, one mot advertise you as a
wit, one adventure immortalize you as a Don Juan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: Will one speech proclaim me an orator?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Speeches are swallows that never
make a summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Do you take things seriously, Mr. Jordan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Really, Selina, you make me ashamed
of your upbringing. You mustn’t ask a rising young
statesman a question like that. He might have to
say “yes” and then we should think him a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: Don’t worry, Miss Selina. I am brave
enough to admit that I take some things seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: Some women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: The election wasn’t lost on you,
Jordan; you learnt to qualify.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Do please tell us a little more. Are the
women you take seriously serious women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Selina, you are my daughter, and
in every sense of the word, my creation. I have told
you before now that your cousin Ann is the only serious
woman in the world. I am for the moment using the
term woman as a form of praise. There are, of course,
many serious persons of the female sex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I don’t call Ann serious. She bubbles over
with gaiety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: But she takes things seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: She is good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: She is unique. A woman we all
adore, who can be described as good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Do you adore Ann, Mr. Jordan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Well, I wish she weren’t up to so
many good works. As for her virtue it is a “Trespassers
will be prosecuted” signal that you can see for
miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Papa, I think you’re very vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Ann is so radiantly uncensoriously good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Ann is a damned good-looking woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: But she does lead a silly life. I did
think that once the war was over and she had stopped
nursing cholera in Siberia we should be all right. But
what has peace brought us? Why, the house is positively
infested with Mayors and clergymen and cranks
and old maids, and when she’s tired of talking to her
Socialist friends, she thinks of Ninian, <i>plasters</i> on the
family jewels, resumes the rôle of the Lord Lieutenant’s
wife and entertains the county. Disgusting, I call it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: William and I have never believed in
entertaining the county.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I confess I am sometimes entertained
by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: My appetite is too jaded to enjoy the
hunting exploits of the squire or the cameos of his lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: And the parson is always collecting
for an organ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Ann is so strange; she really
seems to enjoy it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timothy</span>: That is because everything is dramatic
to her. She doesn’t know what patronage means, so
everyone tells her their secrets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: They can’t be very interesting
secrets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timothy</span>: All secrets are interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: All secrets are the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: The tiresome thing about a secret
is that no one believes you know one till you’ve told it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Ann is so patient. She can listen
for hours to the laundry-maid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timothy</span>: Ann is so interested. She knows that
all of the romance in the world is contained in the
laundry-maid’s love affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: All lovers are the same. That is why
I gave up being one. I realized that the only new rôle
I could assume was that of a husband, and marriage
seemed too heavy a price to pay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: And everyone knows all about
husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: To tell you the truth, I wanted to
keep one illusion. I was afraid that if I married I
might discover that wives deceive their lovers with
their husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Molly and I gave up sentimental
adventures when we noticed that we were becoming
sentimental. We decided to take to dry wit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: We are universally considered as wits,
and as that reputation, so easily gained, is impossible
to lose, we are dragooned by public opinion and our own
self-respect into living up to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: You see, Jordan, a reputation is a
prison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: And self-respect is the jailor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: What is self-respect, Tim?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: The thing that makes Mrs. Martineau dress
for dinner when she is alone in the country, that prevents
Jordan from buying a vote, Lord William from
making a bad joke——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: And Ann from having a lover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Lord bless my soul, Ann has not
been prevented from having a lover. The possibility
never occurred to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: If it did she would reject it without
a pang. Ann’s moral tidiness is unequalled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span> (<i>angrily</i>): Is that your definition of effortless
radiant goodness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: I only meant that Ann is not
exactly a Bohemian. All her meals are in the dining-room.
There are no trays in her life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: That is Ninian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Well, she is responsible for him,
isn’t she? Husbands aren’t gifts from God like one’s
relations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: A husband is every woman’s first big
mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Which is the next?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Her second lover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: How subtle you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: A woman’s first lover is usually a
slight caricature of her husband. People don’t escape
from one thing to another, but from one thing to the
same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: There you are again, Bill, always
dragging in your confounded philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: What is your philosophy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: It isn’t really philosophy at all—Bill
maintains that life is a merry-go-round always
coming back to the same point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: And we poor fools think that we
are steering our painted swans when we can turn them
neither to right nor to left. Why, we can’t even make
them go faster or slower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: You don’t believe in free will, Lord William?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I believe that one can fall off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Mr. Jordan, do you think that this is the
right atmosphere in which to bring up a young girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: We shall drive you to romance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: And then what will become of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: You will return to us, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I can’t think why Ann has you in the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I am her uncle. She believes that
Molly has a heart of gold. Mrs. Martineau played with
her in the nursery. Tim is a saint, and Jordan, as he
told you, takes some women and some things seriously.
Ann is the woman and she selects the things.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Lady Emily Cathcart</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Where is Ann?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Still at her Red Cross meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Emily, as a maiden lady of immaculate
reputation——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Remember you are speaking of your
sister, Bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Molly, you are taking away my
character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span> (<i>gallantly</i>): I am too modest to hope to
succeed where so many have failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I was about to ask my sister, before
Molly interrupted with the rather half-hearted propositions
we have just been listening to—I was about to ask
my sister whether she does not consider that Ann is
becoming almost too much of a good thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Too good, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: For this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: For our world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Ann couldn’t live in your world. It is too
small. She would die for lack of exercise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: She will die of exhaustion if she
tries to combine Whitechapel and the County.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: I regard Ninian as the most fatiguing
item in the account. He has only two topics of conversation—his
responsibilities and his improvements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: And if you boil them down, they
become the same thing—his pigstys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: You’re a nice unselfish boy, Tim:
couldn’t you kill Ninian?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Wait a moment, Tim. This requires
serious consideration. Wouldn’t Ninian’s death leave
Ann even busier than she is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: And she might marry someone she
loved, which would be very inconvenient for you all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: I don’t see that we profit much by the
present state of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Ann’s in touch with so many kinds of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Ann is a woman of the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: But not of this age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Ann is the only spot of repose in the
twentieth century. When she sits in a chair she doesn’t
fidget; when she talks to you her attention doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
wander to someone else. When she wants to be listened
to, she lowers her voice a little. I am sure that when
she goes to bed she sleeps, and that when she wakes
up she is refreshed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Mr. Molyneux, you’re quite romantic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: You talk very little for a politician,
Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jordan</span>: You all talk so well, it is a pleasure to listen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: What you mean is, that we are difficult
to interrupt. It is quite true. But once you cease to
be discouraged by finding that what you hoped was going
to be a solo is either a duet or a chorus, you will soon
begin to rush in on all occasions, and ultimately you
will learn to force a hearing for yourself.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Ann</span>.</i></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>They all get up and help her off with her things,
finally pushing her on to a sofa.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: How spoilt I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: How tired you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: But being with you all will soon put that right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: You have missed a lot, Ann. Molly
and I were at our best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I hate to have missed a moment of it, but you
are both always at your best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: We were all very characteristic. Aunt
Emily flirted with Mr. Molyneux, and Mrs. Martineau
tried to flirt with Tim; Papa balanced precariously
on a tight-rope of wit over an abyss of vulgarity, and Mr.
Jordan was silent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: And what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I helped them to their remarks by asking
questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Selina treats everyone as if they
were performing animals. Except animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I love animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: It all sounds delightful. What did you talk
about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: About you, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: We tried to talk about other things,
but you have a way of making conversation into a
boomerang.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I am afraid you can’t have said nice things,
or the conversation would have died out very quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: We said that you were unique, good,
and yet adored by us all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Molly said that. Whenever anyone
describes a conversation, they always repeat their own
remarks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What did you say, Uncle Bill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I said that as far as you were concerned,
winning the war had done us no good at all,
that your life was becoming a perfect slum of good
works. We all feel that we are between the Scylla of
Whitechapel and the Charybdis of the County.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: We must tell Ninian that the County has
been rechristened Charybdis. The Lord Lieutenant of
Charybdis—what a magnificent title!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: In reality, as you know, I am an altogether
self-indulgent woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: You are so charming, Ann darling,
that you entangle other people’s selfishness—to be self-sacrificing
is useless. The essential thing is to receive
the egotism of others on deposit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I know that you are all shamefully nice to me,
and the result is that I spend the whole time with you
when I ought to be talking to the vicar or calling on
Lady Bootle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: How is the dear old vicar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: And Mrs. Sidebotham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: She prefers it to be pronounced Si<i>de</i>botham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: And being very properly called
Amy, she spells it Aimee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: She still believes in the aristocracy.
So lucky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Faith is the substance of things hoped
for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Do you think she is as complicated as
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: She asked me after William, saying,
“Your dear brother will have his little joke.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Couldn’t you explain to her, Ann,
that my jokes are large and monumental, and world-famous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I don’t think she would understand. To Mrs.
Si<i>de</i>botham all jokes are “little jokes,”—household pets
in fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Personally, I prefer the dear vicar
to his wife. Can’t you give me any news of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: He is such a kind man—just as high as ever,
calling the Church of England the Catholic Church, with
a long “a,” and he knows that Christ was a Jew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Did you tell him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I don’t think so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Well, he couldn’t have heard it from
Ninian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I hated him when I was a child. He always
said “How are <i>we</i> this morning?” And I never could
abide the medical touch in private life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Ann, you are very stingy of the County
news, which, however much we may try to conceal it,
really thrills us. How is Lady Bootle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Very rich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I don’t like her wig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Why do wigs always calumniate
hair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You will see them all at dinner to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: And Sir Henry Bootle will say to Ninian:
“That’s a new acquisition, isn’t it?” pointing to the
oldest family portrait, and Ninian will reply: “It has
hung there for four hundred years.” And Ann will
be wretched. Then Lady Bootle will exclaim: “What
a superb emerald,” and Ninian will indicate that it was
given to an ancestress by Catherine the Great, and Ann
will wish she hadn’t put it on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: And the vicar will say to me: “Quite
a stranger, Lady Emily,” which he always says, however
often I come, and I will answer: “I had meant to be
down before,” and he will shake his finger playfully
at me, exclaiming: “A change of mind is the prerogative
of the fair sex.” And at that moment, God
willing, dinner will be announced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I think you are all very unkind, and as I am
very tired I am going to shoo you all away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span> (<i>grumbling</i>): You manage things so
simply, Ann. When you want people to come, you ask
them to come, and when you want them to go, you ask
them to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Why can’t you let the poor child
alone? She is tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: We can believe that she is tired, but
we are incapable of believing that we are not refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Of course you are refreshing. It is only that
I am showing absolute self-interest. I don’t want even
the film of a headache to come between us after dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Molly can never believe that a woman
is resting. He remembers that in his youth it invariably
meant that she was with someone else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: I have always felt that instead of
saying strong as an ox, one should say strong as a
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: You haven’t read your Shakespeare.
“Frailty, thy name is woman.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: That had a moral, not a physical,
significance, my dear. I am not speaking of robust
virtue.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>They are talking themselves out of the room.</i></p>

I do try to keep my thoughts away from you

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: You are so nice, dearest, that you count on my
being a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You’re teasing me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I know you can’t need anything. It is horrible
to have nasty involuntary necessities nibbling things
out of one’s wishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What wishes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: The wish to behave well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I never want to behave well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: You’ve never had to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>to herself</i>): Oh, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I always hope that there are going to be little
things that I can do for you. I don’t ask you to need
things. I only long—quite passionately—for you to
want some thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: It is so complicated—I need your love and I
want you to be happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: How deliciously simple that would be. You
have my love and you make me happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Happy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: My love for you doesn’t make me unhappy
any more. It has become a sort of religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Tim——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: My reverent adoration is without requests and
without claims. I don’t want you to step down off your
altar, dearest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Tim, you frighten me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: And they think you are cold or conventional
because your wonderful goodness is a steady light,
because you know nothing of ugly flares of passion,
which first blind you and then leave everything dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>shutting her eyes</i>): Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: It is so difficult not to be selfish when one loves.
It seems somehow to make everything so personal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>looking into distance</i>): Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: You don’t say “How divinely she walks,” but
“Is she coming straight to me?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: There is a feverish unreality about everything,
so that you feel that even physical pain would soothe
your nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>under her breath</i>): I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span> (<i>has not heard her</i>): You want to be cruel ... or
violent ... or something....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Tim dear, you have never wanted to hurt a
fly in your life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Oh yes, I have. When I first fell in love with
you, I wanted to kill Ninian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: And now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Now I just want to have him killed—not by
my own hand, but impersonally. You see, Ann, you
have taught me that there is something unblessed about
the things you do for your own sake. Does it sound
priggish? I mean that now I quite honestly don’t think
about how things will affect me, but how they will
affect you. It has made me so happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I don’t deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I don’t mean that I don’t want you with every
breath of my body; the whole of me is yearning for you
all the time. I feel a burning wave sweep through me
whenever you walk into the room. When I hear your
name suddenly, it makes me feel sick and giddy and
excited. If I meet you unexpectedly I am like a nervous
actor in the wings, waiting for his cue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Tim....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Does it worry you if I talk like that? I am not
trying to appeal to you, or fuss you, dearest. God
knows I’m not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I know, dear.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She gives him her hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span> (<i>kissing it</i>): Sometimes I have wondered what it
would feel like to kiss you—just once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>putting her face up to him</i>): There.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: No. I’m not going to take advantage of your
generosity. It would be sacrilege. I am not an
irreverent worshipper nor an ungrateful one. I am proud
to be allowed to kiss your finger tips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>bitterly</i>): Why is it the selfish people who get
so much out of one? Why do we go on pouring ourselves
into shallow streams? Why can’t we love the
people we want to love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span> (<i>simply</i>): I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Tim—I wish you didn’t think such wonderful
things about me. Some day you will be so shocked.
So surprised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You will find out that I am not a saint at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I know you are a saint. Nothing can alter
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You have created me in your own image, giving
me all your own lovely qualities. They are a divine
gift, Tim. Thank you for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: What nonsense you talk. Everyone becomes
good when they are with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Some day you may find out terrible things about
me—and then what shall I do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: What you did wouldn’t matter, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>looking at him intensely</i>): Wouldn’t it? Are
you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Quite sure. It’s what you are. The warm
glowing light you give. It doesn’t matter into what
dark corners it goes, does it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>in a whisper</i>): I wonder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: The places it lights and warms aren’t part of the
sun, are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: But people don’t work in that magnificent
way. They select their just and their unjust. What
human being is impartial?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: You are, very nearly. You make everyone
happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I don’t! My God—I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: How I used to curse your marriage to Ninian.
I do still in a way—and yet I am glad—selfishly glad,
perhaps, that you have never been in love, that no
hellish divine unrest has wrought havoc in your heart—that
you are always there, serene and luminous and
tender and whole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>wonderingly</i>): Do you really think I am like
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Yes. Not a searchlight, or a lamp, but sunshine
out of doors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: My dear, I am a nervous, impatient, hungry,
selfish creature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: You are a wicked woman, to fish after all the
divine things I have been saying to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Tim, you spoil me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span> (<i>seizing her shoulders</i>): I’d love to spoil you, all

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: All those lovely precious moments when I
have you to myself ... don’t let them be empty

that we can fill them with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Why do you always want things at fever

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I don’t, but each time I am with you my love
is like a child being born. It tears me to bits. And
then there comes a moment of pure ecstasy and forgetfulness,
and my life ceases to exist, and there is no
time, and everything is simple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: My dear child, your nerves are out of order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Yes.</p>

and matter-of-fact if you’ll only smile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: One can’t always smile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I can never help it when I’m with you. Smiles
seem to flutter about my lips like butterflies. But
sometimes I can’t help thinking—in an hour he’ll be
gone, in ten minutes he’ll be gone. And then when
people come into the room, I try to shut them out of my
consciousness and imagine I am in your arms. Do you
never do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: No.</p>

I think of each finger of your hand and the features
of your face getting closer and closer till they merge
into my face, and your lips creeping about covering
every bit of me with kisses—my neck, my eyes, my lips.

old man talking to me about the Tariff. Do you never

Someone a Cathcart can’t talk to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I can’t bear it. What have I done? Don’t
you love me any more? Don’t I even amuse you?</p>

I suppose I am clumsy—I can’t play it as a game,

I belong to you—all of me—always. Philip, my

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Philip, you are teasing me, aren’t you? You’re
testing me? You want to see how much I care. It
will always be so easy for you to hurt me, dear heart—too
easy to be amusing.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span> is sitting on the sofa beside her and she is

affairs don’t last for ever?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I have never thought of love affairs; I have

which means life.</p>

them, because I know—you have taught me—that

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Ann</span>, alone, walks about humming happily. <span class="smcap">Philip</span> is
shown in by <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>: Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Philip——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Here I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: But you can’t dine——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: No, I must be in the House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>suspiciously</i>): Why do you say “of course”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>smiling</i>): Because I am so well trained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: You sounded as if you were thinking of
something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: My mind was in that rare and delightful
state known as a perfect blank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: You don’t usually say “of course” when I
break an engagement with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You told me it was so important to be sensible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I doubt if the Almighty Himself could make
you sensible. It wasn’t part of His conception——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: But I have always known that you ought to
go more to the House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>sharply</i>): What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: That to be young and charming and promising
and intelligent means nothing compared to being on the
spot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: How practical you are getting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: It isn’t that I am getting practical; it is that
every day you seem to be becoming more and more a
part of me. You see, if you are always with me, it
doesn’t matter quite so much that you should sometimes
be away from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I don’t see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Loving you used to make me unhappy, but
now it makes me happy—now that I am sure. I used
to feel “He isn’t looking at me, he isn’t thinking about
me, his eyes aren’t even straying in my direction. He
is quite happy on that sofa, quite concentrated—if
only he were inattentive. But he isn’t.” But now I
feel “It doesn’t matter what woman he is with, or what
man—his heart is with me. I don’t need any stray
looks, any accidental jealousy—he means so much to
me now that I don’t want him to be anxious when he’s
away from me. I want him to be confident.” When
you are a little bit in love you are flattered by doubt,
but when you really love you only want trust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: You give enough trust for two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You make it so easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Ann——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>thinks better of it</i>): Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Did you want to tell me something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: One can’t tell you anything. You have the
divine scepticism of all the saints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: All saints are unbelievers. They don’t
believe in realities. They don’t even believe in mortality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>passionately</i>): One can’t believe in mortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: You must have seen enough death during
the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: That is why I can’t believe in mortality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Doesn’t it let you down, always following
your hopes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What else can one follow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Anyway, if it doesn’t let you down, it must
let you in for things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: But I like being let in for things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I wonder your illusions aren’t threadbare
by now—you use them enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Philip, why do you go on keeping up a silly
pretence of being hard and cold and cynical and heartless?
They are all such foolish things to be. People
are only hard because they are frightened, and cold
because they are clumsy. As for cynicism, it is so
misleading; it keeps you out of touch with life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: That seems an odd remark for a Cathcart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Uncle Bill and Aunt Emily aren’t really
cynical; they are just a little out of tune with the sort
of lives we live. You ought to think of them as delicious
museum pieces. You watch Uncle Bill if somebody
makes a pun—he glows—not because he very much
likes puns, but because they make him feel young. It
must be so sad to see the world drifting away out of
your ken into a strange new century full of distorted
angles and alien values.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>violently</i>): I don’t understand you, any of
you—your uncle or your aunt or Selina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>interrupting</i>): Selina is just very young and
uncompromising—a ruthless, fastidious realist. At least
she thinks she is a realist, because she can face things,
but it is so easy to face things before one has ever been
hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Then there is you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>laughing</i>): There is me. (<i>Tenderly</i>): Are you
glad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>who is walking up and down</i>): You are the
most mysterious of them all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I am simplicity itself. It is only because
you love me that you think me mysterious. The person
you love is always mysterious because you have encircled
them in the great mystery of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>who is taking no notice of what she is saying</i>):
They all think you a saint, and they are right, I suppose.
You see no evil, in anyone, not even in yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Philip, how can you say a thing like that?
No one knows better than I do that I am riddled with
faults.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: You are practically faultless, and yet it
would seem as if virtue meant nothing to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What do you mean by virtue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: What other people mean by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: That one’s body matters more than anything
else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I shouldn’t have put it like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Nor would the other people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: You think nothing of having a lover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I think everything of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: You don’t mind deceiving your husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You know I would have told him long ago if
you had let me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>in despair at her blindness</i>): Good God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Don’t you remember we thought that although
he doesn’t love me it would hurt him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>sneering</i>): Ninian too is like <i>other</i> people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Yes—once one has given one’s heart all other
gifts are so small. That is where it seems to me that
the moralists go wrong—they seem to think the body so
much more important than the heart or the soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Moralists aren’t occupied with the heart
or the soul. They are interested in the structure of
society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Then why don’t they become county councillors
or politicians?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Because they would find difficulty in getting
elected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You look tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I am tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What has tired you? The things you have
done or the things you haven’t done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>sharply</i>): What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Everything—anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: There is nothing to tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>teasing</i>): You look like a man with a guilty
secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>startled</i>): What are you driving at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>still gay</i>): How should I know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Well, I must be going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Already?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Your guests will be arriving in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Philip, please say something nice to me before
you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: What do you mean by a nice thing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Something obvious and all-embracing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: So you’ve reached the obvious, have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I have always believed in the obvious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: What would you call an obvious and all-embracing
thing to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Why do women always want to be told that
one loves them? They must know whether it is true
or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: There may be truths that are better left unsaid,
but there are no nice truths that are not the better for
being repeated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Do you call love a nice truth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: A respectable truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: So long as you change the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Don’t tease me, sweet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I’m not teasing you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>stroking his forehead</i>): I don’t want you to be
tired or worried.... I don’t want you to have a conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Not any conscience at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: A preventive conscience but not a retrospective
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I think it is better to worry after than
before ... a sin followed by a regret is better than a
blank preceded by a doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: It might be such a small sin and such a big
regret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Why do you look so happy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I am so happy.</p>

There are moments when I wish I had managed it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I would always be alone if I knew you were

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: When were you first ruined, Uncle Bill?</p>

quite properly, the method I selected for coming of age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What was she like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: She was dashing—damned expensive
too. I will say that for her. Now you could ruin a
young man without costing him a penny.</p>

economy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I’m sorry, my dear. For a moment
sordid financial considerations arose in my mind with
the memory of Annette. We were all so affected by
Ouida in those days. It never occurred to us to do
anything simply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: And now I suppose you think that we none of
us do anything well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: A little slipshod, a little casual, I
find you. And your young men are so lacking in persistence
that your young women can’t afford any
subtlety. If men go about taking no for an answer
they can’t expect to get “no” said to them, and there
is nothing like affirmatives for taking the savour out of
an affair.</p>

when Molly was first attentive to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Very clearly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Molly was a buffoon in those days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Really, William, you should not betray
the secrets of our youth. Ann, who is romantic,
believes that Molly was the most tender of lovers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Well, even when you lay your <i>amour
propre</i> aside you will admit that Molly was, if possible,
far more tender than passionate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Fiddlesticks! Molly was never in the
least tender, nor for that matter was he in the least
passionate either. But he was not more ridiculous
than any other young man who adopts an attitude
unpropelled by an impulse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What was his attitude?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: In the year ’80, to which William is
referring, his attitude was one of affection towards
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I am sure that that was quite sincere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Perfectly. He liked me in private
and loved me in public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You mean that he was shy when he was alone
with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: No. I mean that he was frank when
he was alone with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What a divine compliment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: The truth is the most tiresome of all
compliments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: When I am flattered I always
imagine that I have been told the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: William has always been vain—whereas
I have been selfish, which is a much more
artistic achievement. When William was young, he
succumbed to every temptation—a sad lack both of
fastidiousness and of concentration. I, on the other
hand, determined to miss chances and take opportunities.
I succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Your aunt means that she remained
unmarried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: On purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: A misguided objective.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: The stationary is no achievement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I cannot see how being rich can affect the

Going to the bad is very difficult.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Why so difficult?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Could anything be more Prussian

one another night after night, just as if cooking were

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: I am so glad you like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You are always so beautifully dressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: That is because I insist on having
the clothes made by the French for the French; not the
models designed for export purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: What is the difference?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: When an Englishwoman or an
American goes into Callot, or Cheruit, the <i>vendeuse</i>
instantly shows her the most elaborate things she has
got—lace, flowers, furs and furbelows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Out of contempt for our taste and
desire to make the price as high as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: And we think it must be all right because of
the name inside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Men are such bad judges of clothing!
They like crude colours and they notice nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: No. They say, “Kitty had on a divine
dress,” and you ask, “What colour was it?” and
they explain, “Kind of orange,” and it turns out to have
been jade green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: And they always admire on other women the
sort of clothes they deprecate for their wives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: And they talk about the conspicuous,
which doesn’t mean anything. Of course it is
dreadful to be conspicuously imperfect, just as it is
delightful to be conspicuously perfect. But the conspicuousness
is just underlining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: So few of us can afford to be underlined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Blue serge and black velvet are safest in all
things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: There isn’t much blue serge and
black velvet about you, Selina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: To annoy women, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: With some people all admiration is a
form of envy, and all pleasure is a compound of pleasing
and annoying your friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: How moral you are this evening, Aunt
Emily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Not moral, my dear, moralizing—it’s
not the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: No, indeed. Look at Ann. She never

But with approaching senility he requires a romance
to look back on. I don’t know why he chooses me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Because he loved you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Nonsense, but I’m honoured to play
my part in this haze of rosy retrospect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: What a lovely phrase....</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She hums.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: ... haze of rosy retrospect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span> (<i>severely</i>): You manage to give everything
a music-hall touch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Papa thinks I am very eighteenth-century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Your father likes to think himself
eighteenth-century. A halo of wit ’round coarseness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span> (<i>who is looking at an illustrated paper</i>): I love
dogs. They are such wonderful company and they
never talk about Bolshevism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: It is a devastating topic. Everyone always
gets cross and silly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: And they go on overstating their cases until
it becomes an auction of folly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: It is extraordinary how exacerbating
subjects of world importance can be. After an hour
of Ninian, I find myself getting frenzied about Smyrna.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Pro-Turk or pro-Greek?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: I forget which. It depends on the
other person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Yes. When we are with the vicar, who calls
the Turks infidels, we are pro-Turk; and when we are
with Ninian, who calls the Turks gentlemen, we are
pro-Greek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: It sounds so tiring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: It is. But agreeing with Ninian or the
vicar does no good. It doesn’t stop them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You must make Ninian show you his map of
the water power of Austria-Hungary, showing that it
must remain an Empire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Ninian always proves everything by
diagrams and statistics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: He has designed what he calls a world danger
map, showing Socialist danger centres in red—Glasgow
in scarlet, and Munich in snow-white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: I thought it was a map of scarlet
fever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: So it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You are all very unkind about Ninian. He is
so public-spirited and conscientious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: He is very good-looking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Selina, your habit of interrupting is intolerable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: How very disconcerting, my love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I am going to write a brochure called “The
Quadruple Terror,” or “Where the Rainbow Ends.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: What are you talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: The Red Peril, the White Peril, the Black
Peril, and the Yellow Peril.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Bravo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: That is really a disgracefully bad

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Well, Ninian, did you have a good
meeting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: What met?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: The Conservative Association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: It should be rechristened the Preservative
Association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Little girls should be seen and not heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I should think I could get an engagement to
show myself at parties as the one Silent Cathcart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: My sisters were brought up to speak when
they were spoken to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Did anyone ever talk to them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: If it is fine on Sunday I shall be able to
show you the new cement pigsties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Pigs upset my digestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Model landlords exhaust my
vocabulary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span> (<i>undeterred</i>): You may not be aware of the
fact that pigs are very clean animals. It is only a
question of providing them with water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Warm water?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: How conscientious you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I was brought up with a sense of duty.
My father said to me, “Ninian, remember five centuries
of Candovers are watching you.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Wasn’t he quoting Napoleon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Certainly not. In any case, he always
referred to him as Bonaparte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Oh, Ninian, was that a nice way of talking
of the dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: How lucky that etiquette always
prevents us from saying disagreeable things about the
departed. It leaves so much more for the living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: But Lord Candover was a pioneer. He
didn’t believe in respecting tombstones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I wish you wouldn’t twist my words, Selina.
My father was most careful in speaking of the dead,
and I am sure he would have hated to be called a pioneer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I beg your pardon. He only felt free to
insult the immortal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: We are all of us immortal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: But the fact is only known about
some of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Tim</span>. They are on stool D. S. C.
and she speaks in an undertone that is not heard by the
rest of the party</i>): What is the matter with Ann?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Is anything the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: She’s been so moody lately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: She overworks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Every time I see Ninian I realize
that marriage to him was the only adequate punishment
for marrying him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: He is very good-looking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Why did Ann do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: She was very young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Youth is an excuse for doing something
foolish, not for doing something suitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I don’t suppose that the worldly side of the
thing ever struck her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Then it was pure bad taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: She was probably in love with love and he was
its first representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: And when the romance wore off
there was fifty thousand a year left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I don’t think that is a very nice thing to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: How you adore her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Everyone does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Ninian, have you ever thought of becoming
a Mayor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Mayor? Mayor of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: It wouldn’t matter. Any town would do.
Papa, wouldn’t Ninian make an excellent Mayor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I really can’t say, my dear. I’ve
never seen one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Ann knows lots. She adores them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: In that case it would be quite proper
that her husband should join the company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Ann, how silent you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I was always the most silent of the Cathcarts,
but even that is enough to get me the reputation of
a chatterbox outside the family circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Uncle William, I am very glad you should
be here, as I am thinking of starting a league for combating
budding Bolshevism in this country. Your
active help would be invaluable to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Molly and I are too old to see red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: And being autocrats ourselves we approve
of Lenin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I suppose you feel bound to fight
the only people who hate liberty more than you do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I don’t understand. Education is at the
bottom of all the mischief; teaches the people discontent
and damned little else. What does a working-man
need to know except how to do an honest day’s work
and watch his cricket or his football on a Saturday?
As a landlord I regard my tenants as my children,
and I know them well enough to know that good old
English ale and good old English sport mean a damned
sight more to them than cheap editions of the classics.
Being educated above their station, that’s what they
are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: That would not teach them much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I don’t know what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I have often heard you say yourself, Ninian,
that the only thing a gentleman need learn is how to
play the game—which, by the way, he ought to be born
knowing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: In case of accidents there’s Eton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Waterloo was won on the playing fields of
Eton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: But <i>Hamlet</i> wasn’t written there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I always find it so difficult to write
out of doors. However still the day, there’s always
enough breeze to blow the paper about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I don’t see what that has to do with education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: It all comes from your anti-Bolshevist
League.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Don’t let’s talk politics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I am going to write a song for Ninian to
sing with the refrain: “I’m a red rag to the Reds, so
we’re all of us red together.” It will be called the
Red Pottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Selina, don’t you think you could
write a revue? Then Molly and I could get off some of
our vulgarer jokes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: What a good idea! Then, when you want
to say something really outrageous, you need only make
a note of it, and we will use it in <i>Whispers</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: What do you say, Selina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I am going to write a revue called <i>Whispers</i>
as a lightning conductor for papa’s vulgarer jokes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Why <i>Whispers</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Because it sounds so indiscreet. Haven’t
you noticed that no one ever listens until one drops
one’s voice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I should have thought it was easier to hear
people who raised their voices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Don’t you see? Then one doesn’t want to
hear them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: You are all too clever for me. But I really
don’t know where it leads you to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: It has made Lord William and
Mr. Molyneux the two most sought-after men in London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: It has helped Emily to avoid marriage
and enabled her to lead her own life with admirable
indiscretion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: It has made me a comfort to my father in
his old age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: We have only one regret. It has not
prevented Ann and Tim from being saints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Ann has no temptations and Tim is indoors
too much.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He caresses <span class="smcap">Ann’s</span> hair and she shudders a little.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: How is the dear vicar—still pro-Semite?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What a memory you’ve got, Uncle Bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: And my friend, Mrs. Sidebotham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Si<i>de</i>botham, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: She told me that you had said something very
funny to her last time you met, and that unfortunately
she has forgotten it, and couldn’t you remember what
it was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: A most insulting woman to think that
I have a limited supply of labelled witticisms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: The last time we were altogether
there was that young politician.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Jordan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Yes, that’s the man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Do you remember how we teased him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I only remember your asking him if he took
things seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: It was a delicate way of suggesting that he
took himself seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: That was abundantly clear without
any hint from you, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: He certainly didn’t fit into our airy
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: He was like a porpoise among gold fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: But we agreed that it was a mistake
to waste malice on the dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>with a muffled cry</i>): The dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: His reputation has come to an
untimely end. He is, however, I believe, in excellent
health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: What did his reputation die of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: I suggest drink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: He was never quite a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Do gentlemen always have strong heads?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: They sometimes have a good wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Was that it? Do tell us about it.
Did he get very drunk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: As Ninian would say, he couldn’t carry his
liquor like a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Nor can most gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: But he can’t have ruined himself
so quickly for such a common failing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Shall we assume that he drugged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Or gambled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Another gentlemanly vice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: We can pretend, if you prefer it, that
he lost his temper when he lost, and crowed when he
won.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: I suggest a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: What sort of woman shall we have—a
poor victim, or a common vampire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Let us have both—the one to prove him a
villain, and the other a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Why are you so vindictive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Because I was so much bored. “I am brave
enough to admit, Miss Selina, that I take some things
seriously.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: The best thing about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: But even with all the details that
we have supplied, I don’t see how he lost his reputation
as a politician.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: It is probably only a temporary eclipse.
No one’s political career is ever over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: If you will allow me to get in a word
edgeways, I will tell you the whole story. It was last
night—I heard all about it at my Club at lunch to-day—Jordan
had promised to make a most important
speech. The Prime Minister, depending on him, left
the House, but when the time came he was nowhere
to be found. The situation was critical, and the Government
only just squeaked through. So you see his
position in his party isn’t very rosy for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Probably it was cowardice, thought the
ship was sinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: But where was he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: With a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: What sort of a woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: A woman he had picked up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I really don’t know one street from
another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: There isn’t very much variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Jordan wasn’t the sort of man to
get as far even as a circus. Now in my day it wasn’t
etiquette to begin lower than a circus-rider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: We didn’t know what economy meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: If Jordan was drunk he was probably
quite right to pick without choosing. At the time he
could tell nothing, and by morning his purse must have
been his sole criterion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: Did you have a headache, dear?
Was that what made him run round at the crucial
moment in the Debate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Fancy Mr. Jordan forgetting <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martineau</span>: How did you let him know,

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Did he just come round and say, “You
wanted me; here I am?” How delightfully romantic.</p>

call me a statesman, rather let it be said of me, ‘He was
a friend!’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Don’t be absurd. By the worst, Molyneux
means your assertion that Jordan was your lover. If
that story got about, someone who didn’t know you
might believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>quite calmly</i>): It’s true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: It is delightful to know anyone as
innocent as you are, Ann. To sit there deliberately
and tell us a fifth-rate politician is your lover! Even
we did not think you as ignorant of the usages of <i>La Vie
Galante</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Don’t you see it is not a question of <i>la vie

with lovers use their liaisons as alibis for politicians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Tim! Who was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: It was Mrs. Martineau who spread the story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Viper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I should like to gag her with thistles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Have you seen her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I met her in the street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: I trust you did not cut her. It is
better to hear what people have to say first, then you
can cut them afterwards with all the more reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: I am afraid I told her what I thought about her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: What did she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: She said that of course she did not believe
Ann’s story, but that it was so interesting that Ann
should have cared enough for Jordan to invent it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Brute!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Afterwards, when she was really angry, she
remarked that she had been sure that we would all like
to feel that the world had been able to benefit by this
wonderful story of Ann’s unworldliness and high sense
of friendship, as these qualities are so rarely seen and
still more rarely believed in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I can hear her saying it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Have you seen Ann?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: No, I only came an hour ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: It’s all very trying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: It is having a saint like Ann discussed at all
that makes one so sick. It is like seeing people without
religion in a church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I wouldn’t mind so much if they knew Ann.
She is a miracle no one can deny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: What line does Ninian take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: At last Ninian’s qualities are coming in
handy. He is incredibly grand, and, of course, it comes
quite naturally to him. He is prepared to horse-whip
anyone. He talks about “my wife.” He does not,
of course, <i>say</i> she is above suspicion. That would be
to cast a slur upon himself. Who was Cæsar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Ninian is one of those men who believe
implicitly in their own all-conquering charm and,
consequently, in the absence of temperament of every
woman who resists them. They never consider the
possibility of anyone who is not passionately in love
with them being passionately in love with anyone else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: Well, no one suspects Ann of being in love with
Jordan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Ah—no.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He obviously knows the truth.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: It is wonderful of her suddenly to invent a
story like that, but, of course, I do see that it was rather
trying for Ninian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Have you seen Mr. Jordan since, Papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: He must have been dreadfully upset at all the
worry poor Ann is having.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: He seemed to be thinking mainly of
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: There are two things I can’t forgive Ann.
One is her marriage with Ninian, and the other her
friendship with Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: They would, no doubt, each agree
with you about the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim</span>: But for that Martineau woman, no one would
have known anything about it.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Ann</span>, looking white and wretched, she kisses
<span class="smcap">Lord William</span> and <span class="smcap">Selina</span>, and <span class="smcap">Tim</span> kisses her hands.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What were you saying about Mabel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: The viper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: That woman is a hell cat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Poor thing! I don’t think she means it. Her
tongue runs away with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Tim wants to gag her with thistles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I didn’t know you went in for ingenious
tortures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Tim is a little more discriminating in
his charity than you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Where is Ninian?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: At his anti-Bolshevist Committee Meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Is that bud bursting into flower?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: It keeps a lot of violent-minded people busy.
If “minded” be the word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: I had a letter from Mrs. Sidebotham—Si<i>de</i>botham
... this morning. She wants me to
organize an entertainment in the village. I am afraid
that Papa’s vulgar jokes wouldn’t do for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Nor would Red Pottage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: “I’m a red rag to the Reds, so we’re all of
us red together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Is it to be in aid of the organ?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: It is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: No one can say that I don’t know
all about village life. I’ve not forgotten my youth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What was Grandpapa like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Very formidable—arrogant, dry, autocratic,
with magnificent manners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: That’s what Ninian’s generation misses. They
take themselves very seriously, but somehow they are
not in the least formidable. Just very long and a tiny
bit ridiculous.</p>

them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Ann, there are moments when you don’t
seem to me quite normal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I have come here to talk sense, not to make
love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Love is the only sense in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: In the whole of my life I have never met
anyone so deliberately blind as you are. You ignore
all values except the ones you have created yourself.
Quite suddenly, on the spur of the moment, you ruin
my reputation and your own and then sit there quite
calmly, talking about love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: But I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: What in God’s name has love got to do with
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What else has anything to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Your reputation, my career.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You see, they were all attacking you, saying
monstrous, wicked, lying things, I couldn’t sit there
and listen. I simply told them the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: What did they say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: They said you were frightened. At least,
someone suggested that, and then Mr. Molyneux said
no, you were drunk, and that was why you had failed
the Government. And Uncle Bill told them you had
been with a woman—a woman you had picked up in
the streets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Naturally I denied it. I said that you had
been with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: And they wouldn’t believe you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: No. So I told them that you were my lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Were you mad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Not in the least. It was the obvious thing to
do. I couldn’t sit there and listen to them telling lies
about you—I’m not ashamed of having loved you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Do you mean to sit there and tell me that
all this arose simply because they said I had taken part
in a drunken orgy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: How could I let them say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Good God, do you think anyone cares a
damn? That that sort of thing doesn’t happen to
everyone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I think that it matters very much for a man to
fail his chief when he has trusted him, relied on him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: And if I am with you, am I not equally
failing my chief who has trusted me, relied on me?
Doesn’t that matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I think that matters too. But somehow, love
is a different world—far away beyond our ordinary
lives. It makes everything else seem so distant and
irrelevant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Well, I may as well explain to you that to
me love is an appetite like any other appetite. It is
no better and no worse than drink, and one woman is
no better and no worse than another. At least I used
to think that. But now I realize that a temporary
adventure is nothing to being entangled in the octopus
grip of a love affair with a virtuous woman.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Ann</span> makes a gesture.</i></p>

<p>If you want to have children, marry. If you want to
love you will have to pay the bill, but see that it is a
cash transaction. I meet you—a good woman, a beautiful
woman, a charming woman. I am attracted to
you as hundreds of men have been before me. And then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
suddenly you present me with your virtue. I am flattered,
naturally, I take what the gods give me. Who
wouldn’t? And then, what happens? The woman
who used to believe in virtue, believes in love. A
strange flaming thing this love, before which everything
is sacrificed, pride, discretion, the conventions, reputation.
You are blinded by it. What am I to do?
I tell you things, I warn you, I try to escape. But
everything I say is like describing objects to someone
who can’t see. Gently, serenely, you laugh the foundations
of your life away as if they were irrelevant absurdities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>in agony</i>): Oh....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: And then, one fine day, in a moment of
hysterical exaltation, you pull down the very scaffolding
of the building, and, sitting among the ruins, you still
smile and say: “Love is the only sense in the world.”
A child of ten could have told that I had ceased to care
for you. And I have been sacrificed on my own altar.
Funny, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Oh, my God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Well, I don’t want to waste any time psychologizing.
I want to discuss the situation sensibly.
Does your husband mean to divorce you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: No. You see, he doesn’t believe that I was
telling the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>infinitely relieved</i>): Doesn’t believe that I
have been your lover?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Good God—you are a clever woman, Ann.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: They none of them believe it except Uncle Bill.
They think—it was a mad invention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Well, you must try and make all of your
friends think it was a joke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: But I wanted them to believe it. I—I was
proud of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>brutally</i>): Well, you’re not proud of it now,
are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: No. I don’t think that I shall ever recover
from the shame of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: It’ll soon blow over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I didn’t mean that. Do you think I care what
the world thinks? Do you think I mind the scandal?
It’s having loved you that I mind. That is the shame
that will never wear out.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>There is a pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I suppose I have been saying things I didn’t
altogether mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I don’t think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: It’s no good saying I am sorry, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I should like to try and make you understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I understand everything—now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: At the beginning there are so many things.
Surprise, discovery, exploration, enchantment. You are
always going a step further—a delicious unacknowledged
step—or rather you don’t go further, but you are always
finding yourself further—further and deeper. And
later, when you are tiring, there are still inflamed
moments—moments of passion, meaningless victories of
the senses over the heart, which are greedily accepted
as proofs of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Don’t....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: And with you there was nothing. No pride
I could hurt, no vanity I could offend, no self-respect
I could outrage. You gave your whole self to me, and
therefore I was without weapons. There wasn’t anyone
I could deal with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>icily</i>): Is it usually very easy to bring a woman
to breaking-point—to breaking-off point, I mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> (<i>cynically</i>): It can be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: It has been beautifully done this time. There
is nothing left, nothing at all, no mess of regrets and
pangs and importunities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: Ann, Ann dearest, don’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>with immense scorn</i>): Are you going to make
<i>love</i> to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: There is no making about it. I have cared
very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You are incredible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>: I wouldn’t like to leave you unnecessarily
hurt by foolish things that I said in a temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: You have not hurt me; you have emptied me,
depopulated me of everything I have ever known and
believed. I shall be able to go out and look at life and
try to find out what things exist and where they are.</p>

it with flaming passion. No one believes you. Of
course it isn’t true. You are the saint. What you say
is only the flaring loyalty of friendship. You are such a
wonderful friend, with such a beautiful, unworldly
sense of the relationship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Don’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: You all think I’m a fool, don’t you? I
can’t talk. I’m not witty. I take myself seriously, and
my duties seriously. Supposing some day you discover
that I was not stupid as I seemed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I never thought you stupid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Because I don’t choose to play at eighteenth-century
conversations with two ridiculous old men and
one intolerable young girl, because I have nothing to
say to your disreputable old aunt, you think I see nothing.
I let them laugh at me because it is the only thing
they <i>can</i> do; but sometimes when I am alone, I laugh
at them—I, who have no sense of humour; Ninian,
your one great blunder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Well, you’ve often had your little laughs
against me. Now, for a change, you and I are going to
be fellow conspirators.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>frightened</i>): What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I’m a simple man; I don’t go in for psychology.
I can’t talk. I don’t want to. It is a curtain
between you and life. Your uncle, your aunt, Molyneux,
Selina, they make patterns over everything, but
it doesn’t change the underneath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: They only pretend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: They think they pretend, but they get
caught themselves. They thought it would be amusing
to have a saint in the family. You were the only possible
candidate. In fact, I agree that you fitted admirably
into the rôle. You are unselfish and conscientious
and charitable. Only you upset their calculations by
being a real person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: They are all like that underneath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: And you fell in love; that made you more
human still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: And one day, their artificial chatter became
unbearable and you told them the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Do you mean that silly joke about Mr. Jordan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Precisely. But they were so well trained
that they didn’t believe you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: You weren’t playing the game of love
according to their rules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>terrified</i>): Ninian!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: So they pointed out to one another that
you were rather more of a saint than even they had
supposed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Ninian, why are you torturing me? Pretending
to believe that ridiculous story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I have watched you for some time, my dear,
and I have come to the conclusion that you are suffering
from a very dangerous disease. Ann, you are a human
being. Incidentally, you are my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: You haven’t been much of a wife to me,
have you, my little Ann?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Ninian</span> is getting closer to her. <span class="smcap">Ann</span> recoils.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I have tried to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: You have been the wife of the Lord Lieutenant,
the mistress of his household. Now, my darling,
you are going to be my wife, my mistress.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>His tone is half bullying, half insinuating. He
is obviously enjoying having her on the rack.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Ninian, you are so different. I—you—I
mean I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: You’ll soon know, my darling. Don’t
shudder.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Ann</span> has got up and is moving away from him.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Come here!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Like a C. O.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Come here!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Ninian</span> gets up and drags <span class="smcap">Ann</span> to the sofa, pushing
her on to her knees and imprisoning her between
his two legs. With one hand he is holding her two
wrists behind her back, with the other he is stroking
her hair.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: They didn’t know how to treat you, did
they? Tim and the others? Only Jordan knew.
Women always capitulate to the men who think lightly
of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Ninian, you’re hurting me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I’m asserting myself, my dear. Master
and Mistress—that’s what a household needs.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He laughs.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: By Jove, that’s good—worthy of your uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Let me go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Where are those beautiful manners? Say
“Please let me go, dear Ninian.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Please let me go.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Ninian</span> releases her. She gets up and walks
towards the window.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I didn’t say you might walk away. Sit
there. It is delightful to feel that we are sharing a
secret—fellow conspirators.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Where is the charming family chatter?
And surely even your usual courtesy would compel
you to answer when you are spoken to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Ninian, please let me go and wash my face
and tidy my hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: By all means. Make yourself pretty. I
shall still be here.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Ann</span>.</i></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Lord William</span> and <span class="smcap">Selina</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Good morning, Ninian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Good morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: You seem in excellent spirits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Bolshies red as ever?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Red as the faces of their most apoplectic
opponents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Papa, you’re getting vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: It is a sad thing that a man with your
father’s attainments should not have devoted his gifts
to the service of his country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span> (<i>dryly</i>): I leave that to you and Jordan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>: Mr. Jordan is altogether detestable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: By the way, Ninian, I’ve found
something out about Jordan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: That night when he didn’t turn up
to make his speech. You remember? The occasion
Ann made that tirade about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Well, it was true. He was with a
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span> (<i>paling</i>): What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Tommy Dunn saw him getting out
of a taxi with a woman at one a.m. at the door of a block
of flats—flats that I am afraid Tommy knows only too
well. He’s quite certain it was Jordan because Jordan’s
hat fell off and he picked it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Good God!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Ann</span>, looking very pale. She has obviously
been weeping.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Ann, did you hear what Uncle William said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Yes, I knew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Knew what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Knew that Mr. Jordan was with a woman that
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Then why the devil——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I know. I was a fool. It was a silly thing to
do. It was the first thing that came into my head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span>: Uncle William, I have insulted my wife this
morning in a way that no woman has ever been insulted
before. Ann, do you think that you can ever forgive
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: I forgive you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninian</span> (<i>taking her hand and kissing it</i>): You are a
saint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Alas, no. You were right, Ninian. Only a
human being.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Molyneux</span> and <span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>. They
are all talking. <span class="smcap">Lord William</span> and <span class="smcap">Ann</span> are D. S. L.
corner.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: There is nothing like the country, Ann,
nothing like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Home, sweet home. When I am asked
if I have any relations I always say, I have some Cathcart
connections.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>in a tone of desperate weariness</i>): Everything is
going round and round just the same, though the bottom
has fallen out of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: My dear, life is a merry-go-round.
It never stops for you however many things you drop.
The onlooker sees you sitting on the same painted swan,
but he can’t see your broken heart unless you show it
to him. There is only one rule—not to fall off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What is there left for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Your painted swan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: As we were crossing the park we met
the vicar, who said, “Quite a stranger, Lady Emily.”
It is delightful to be able to count on something in this
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>: Candover means a great deal to me.
In the whole shifting scene of life, here alone I find
my certainties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>: Selina, do you remember that little
thing like barley sugar who married a big-game shooter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>desperately, to <span class="smcap">Lord William</span></i>): Listen to them.
I can’t bear it. They are going on as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Nothing has happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: They are just the same—just the same as they
were the day before yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Just the same as they were fifty
years ago. Why should they change now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: And Ninian thinks that he has wronged me,
and Tim believes that I am a saint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: Ninian did wrong you and you are
a saint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: What was it you said? In life we don’t go
from one thing to another, but from one thing to the
same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: You see, one is after all the same
person. Whatever we do, our actions are defeated by
our characters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span>: Then this merry-go-round is a life sentence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span>: And you can’t change your swan
without falling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> (<i>passionately</i>): I want to fall——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William</span> (<i>gently</i>): Listen, my dear, to what
Emily is saying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>:—she really was a very silly woman.
Looking up with her huge blue eyes, she said, “My
husband married me for love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>:—And I commented acidly, “So many
marriages can only be explained by love.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Emily</span>:—And the fool answered, “Dear Mr.
Molyneux, it does me good to hear you say that.
I knew you were an idealist.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molyneux</span>:—And then——?</p>
